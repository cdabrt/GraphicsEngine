# GraphicsEngine  
A work in progress: After many years of experience in OO and functional programming languages I decided to jump into a low-level imperative paradigm using C and also take a leap into the world of graphical computing by starting work on a graphics engine. Low-level programming is not new to me, however, I want to brush up on skills and learn new ones. To make this learning experience more exciting and challenging, I decided to combine it with such a complex project. This way, I combine testing my already existing skills in architecting complex architectures and systems with skills that I will gain in a new programming and computing paradigm.

For now, this is an educational project which also exists to showcase my work on my portfolio if it bears fruit.
